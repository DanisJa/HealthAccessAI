# Medi ‚Äì AI-Powered Hospital Management Platform

## üéØ Project Name: Medi

**Medi** is an intelligent, cross-platform hospital management system that streamlines patient care using AI and real-time data.   
Medi connects web, mobile, and IoT devices into one seamless platform, enabling hospitals to optimize patient intake, triage, and overall workflow with cutting-edge technology.

---

## üîç Project Overview

Medi is an **AI-powered hospital management platform** developed during a hackathon to demonstrate how modern technology can transform healthcare operations. It features a **fully integrated system** with:

- A React web app for administrators, doctors, and patients  
- A React Native mobile app for nursing staff  
- An Arduino-based RFID scanner for physical ID cards  

The platform manages **real-time patient intake** ‚Äî whether a patient schedules online or walks in with an RFID/NFC card ‚Äî and utilizes **zero-shot AI triage** to assist medical decisions.

This means Medi can instantly analyze patient-reported symptoms and vitals to predict possible conditions and suggest treatments **without requiring extensive pre-training** for specific diseases.

In short, Medi bridges the gap between **hospital management** and **intelligent automation**, ensuring that every patient is seen promptly and gets personalized care recommendations across all touchpoints (web, mobile, hardware).

## üì∏ Key Features

*Medi‚Äôs Patient Portal Dashboard* provides a unified view for patients to track appointments, medications, and health parameters.  
The interface is clean and role-based, so each user (*patient, doctor, nurse, admin*) sees a customized set of tools and information.

### üîë Portals & Access

- **Doctor Portal**:  
  A dedicated interface for physicians to monitor their daily schedule and patient information. Doctors have access to a personal **dashboard with analytics** (e.g. number of patients, upcoming appointments), an inbox for **secure messages** from patients or admin, and detailed **electronic medical records** for each patient they see.  
  An integrated **AI prescription assistant** helps doctors by suggesting medication options and dosages based on a patient‚Äôs diagnosis and history (the doctor can review and adjust these suggestions before prescribing).

- **Patient Portal**:  
  An intuitive **patient-facing web app** (login required) where patients can manage their healthcare journey. Patients can **schedule appointments** or view upcoming appointments on a calendar, track their health vitals over time (weight, blood pressure, etc.), review their **medical records and lab results**, and manage medication lists and refill reminders.  
  Uniquely, patients also have access to an **AI Triage Assistant** right from the portal ‚Äî they can describe their symptoms and receive an instant preliminary assessment (possible conditions and guidance) even before seeing a doctor.  
  The portal empowers patients to stay informed and proactive about their health, with features like **reminders** (for medications or follow-up tasks) and the ability to **message their doctor** securely through the platform.

- **Nurse Mobile App (QR-nurse)**:  
  A cross-platform **React Native (Expo)** app designed for on-the-go use by nurses and front-desk staff. Using the mobile app, a nurse can **scan a patient‚Äôs medical ID card** using the phone‚Äôs built-in NFC reader or camera (for QR code) to instantly pull up that patient‚Äôs profile.

  If an arriving patient is not yet registered in the system, the app will guide the nurse to quickly register them on the spot. Upon scanning, Medi automatically places the patient into the **appropriate doctor‚Äôs queue** in real time ‚Äì effectively a digital **triage check-in**.

  This means even walk-in patients (without prior appointments) are accounted for: the system can assign them to the relevant department or doctor based on their needs and current wait times.  
  The nurse can also trigger **queue prioritization** for urgent cases: for example, if a patient‚Äôs scan and triage data indicate a high-risk condition, Medi will flag and bump that patient‚Äôs priority in the queue so doctors are alerted immediately.

  - **Hospital Admin Portal**:  
  A centralized **hospital dashboard** for admin staff to manage doctors, patients, and appointments. Admins can add or remove doctors, register new patients or view all patient profiles, and oversee the appointment schedule for the entire hospital.  
  This portal also includes an **internal messaging system** to broadcast announcements or communicate with doctors and patients.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

Medi is built with a modern stack to ensure scalability and ease of development:

- **Frontend**:  
  React (JavaScript/TypeScript) for the web app UI, styled with Tailwind CSS and components from **shadcn/UI** (a toolkit of pre-built accessible components).  
  This combination enables a fast, responsive interface with a clean design.

- **Mobile**:  
  React Native (Expo) for the cross-platform nurse app. Expo‚Äôs tooling allows quick deployment to iOS/Android, and the app utilizes device hardware (camera/NFC) for scanning patient IDs.

- **Backend**:  
  Supabase ‚Äì a scalable backend-as-a-service based on PostgreSQL. Supabase handles:
  - **Database**: storing users, appointments, medical records, etc.
  - **Authentication**: secure sign-ups and logins for patients, doctors, admins.
  - **Realtime data**: via subscriptions (e.g. instant updates to queues or new messages).
  - **Edge Functions**: (serverless functions) for running custom logic securely (e.g., processing RFID scans or invoking AI models for triage).

- **Hardware/IoT**:  
  Arduino/ESP8266 microcontroller paired with an RFID reader module.  
  This embedded system scans RFID/NFC **medical ID cards** and connects via WiFi (through the ESP8266) to the Medi platform.  
  It communicates with the backend (via HTTP or Supabase RESTful API) to update patient arrival status or register card swipes in real time.

- **AI/ML**:  
  Multiple AI models power Medi‚Äôs smart features. We integrate:
  - **Mistral** (a state-of-the-art open-source Large Language Model) for zero-shot symptom analysis and classification.
  - **BART** (a transformer-based NLP model by Facebook) for natural language processing tasks like generating triage explanations.  
  These models run behind a dedicated API service.

- **APIs & Integration**:  
  A lightweight **FastAPI** (Python) server hosts our AI models and exposes endpoints for inference.  
  The web and mobile apps call these endpoints (e.g., to get a triage prediction or prescription recommendation) via secure HTTP requests.

  FastAPI was chosen for its speed and ease of integrating Python ML libraries.  
  The entire platform‚Äôs components communicate through **RESTful APIs** and **real-time subscriptions**, ensuring that data flows smoothly between the web UI, mobile app, and IoT devices.

## üì± Mobile App (QR-nurse)

The **QR-nurse** mobile app is a crucial part of Medi‚Äôs ecosystem, tailored for nurses and intake staff. Built with Expo and React Native, the app is lightweight and easy to deploy on any smartphone or tablet. Key points about the mobile app:

- **NFC & QR Scanning**:  
  The app uses the device‚Äôs hardware to scan patient ID cards. If the card has an NFC chip, a nurse simply taps it to the phone to retrieve patient info.  
  Alternatively, if the card has a QR code, the app‚Äôs camera scanner can read it. This flexibility ensures compatibility with whatever identification method the hospital uses.

- **Instant Patient Lookup**:  
  Once scanned, the app immediately displays the patient‚Äôs details (name, ID, appointment status, etc.) by fetching data from Supabase.  
  This saves time compared to manual search or data entry.

- **On-the-fly Registration**:  
  For new patients who haven‚Äôt been in the system, nurses can register them right from the app.  
  The registration form on mobile mirrors essential fields (name, DOB, etc.) found on the web registration, creating a new patient profile in the central database within seconds.

- **Queue Assignment**:  
  After scanning or registering, the app will assign the patient to a queue. For example, if the patient has a 10 AM appointment with Dr. Smith, scanning their card will mark them as ‚Äúarrived‚Äù and notify Dr. Smith‚Äôs dashboard in real time.  
  If the patient is a walk-in, the app can either let the nurse choose the appropriate department/doctor or use the AI triage suggestion to route them to a relevant queue.

- **Standalone Repository**:  
  The QR-nurse app code is maintained in a separate repo for clarity and modularity (see the QR-nurse GitHub repository).  
  This separation allows the mobile app to evolve independently. To run the app, developers can clone that repo and follow its README ‚Äì it‚Äôs an Expo project, so one can start it easily with `npm install` and `expo start`.  
  (See **Setup** below for more on running the app.)

## üß† IoT Integration (RFID Scanner)

To bridge the gap between physical hospital workflows and the digital platform, Medi includes an **IoT component**: an Arduino-based RFID scanner.  
This is particularly useful at a hospital‚Äôs check-in desk or triage center. Here‚Äôs how the IoT integration works:

- **Hardware Setup**:  
  We use an **ESP8266** WiFi-enabled microcontroller (NodeMCU board) connected to an RFID reader (for example, an MFRC522 module).  
  The RFID reader can scan contactless cards or wristbands that patients might carry as their hospital ID.

- **Card Scanning**:  
  When a patient arrives, they can tap their RFID/NFC-enabled card on the scanner.  
  The Arduino firmware (C/C++ code in the `ssst-hackathon-arduino` repo) reads the unique ID from the card.

- **Network Communication**:  
  The ESP8266 then uses WiFi to send this ID to the Medi backend.  
  This could be done by calling a Supabase **Edge Function** or a **REST API** endpoint (e.g., a POST request to an `/arrival` endpoint on our FastAPI server).  
  The payload typically contains the card ID (which maps to a patient record) and a timestamp.

- **Realtime Update**:  
  Upon receiving the scanner data, the backend verifies the patient and marks them as arrived.  
  Thanks to Supabase‚Äôs **realtime subscriptions**, the relevant frontends update instantly: the hospital admin/doctor dashboard will show that the patient is in the waiting queue.  
  If the card ID isn‚Äôt recognized (no patient record yet), the system can flag it so a nurse can register that person via the mobile app.

- **Fail-safes and

## üß† AI Capabilities

Medi‚Äôs standout feature is its **AI-driven intelligence** that assists in clinical decision-making and patient guidance:

> *The Online Triage form in the patient portal allows users to input symptoms and vitals.  
> Medi‚Äôs AI analyzes this information to predict possible conditions and provide guidance instantly, showcasing the platform‚Äôs smart triage capability.*

- **Zero-Shot Symptom Classification**:  
  At the core of Medi‚Äôs triage system is a powerful **zero-shot learning model** (based on **Mistral**).  
  This means the AI can understand and categorize symptoms it hasn‚Äôt been explicitly trained on.  
  A patient can input a description like ‚Äúfever, cough, and fatigue,‚Äù and the AI will infer possible causes (e.g. *flu*, *common cold*, *COVID-19*) by drawing on its general medical knowledge.  
  It doesn‚Äôt rely on a pre-defined list of symptom-condition mappings; instead, it uses natural language understanding to make an educated guess.

- **Disease‚ÜíMedication Mapping**:  
  Once a likely condition is identified, Medi leverages an internal knowledge base (and AI reasoning) to suggest appropriate **medications and dosages**.  
  For example, if the predicted condition is strep throat, the system might suggest an antibiotic at a standard dosage given the patient‚Äôs age/weight.  
  This feature is like an **AI prescription assistant** that recommends treatments for doctors to consider. It speeds up the prescription process and ensures no key option is overlooked, although the final decision is always left to the medical professional.

- **Personalized Suggestions (Vitals-Aware)**:  
  The accuracy of recommendations improves with more data. Medi‚Äôs AI triage takes into account **vital signs and personal health data** provided by the patient.  
  If the patient‚Äôs profile or triage input includes indicators like high blood pressure, low body weight, or a high fever, the AI will adjust its recommendations accordingly.  
  For instance, certain medications might be ruled out or flagged if the patient‚Äôs blood pressure is elevated.  
  This results in **personalized healthcare advice** that aligns with the patient‚Äôs unique situation, moving away from one-size-fits-all answers.

- **NLP-Based Triage Explanation**:  
  We understand that patients (and even doctors) might be skeptical of an AI-generated diagnosis or curious how it was determined.  
  To foster trust and clarity, Medi uses a **BART-based NLP module** to generate a friendly explanation of the AI‚Äôs reasoning.

  After the AI lists potential conditions, the system can provide a sentence or two like:  
  _‚ÄúBased on the symptoms you entered (fever, cough, fatigue) and your vitals, our system thinks you might have the flu.  
  It suggested this because you have a high temperature and common flu-like symptoms, and it matched your profile (age 30) with typical flu cases.‚Äù_

  This explanation helps users understand the context and logic, turning a black-box prediction into a **transparent, informative triage report**.

- **Continuous Learning Potential** *(Planned)*:  
  As more patients use the triage and as doctors provide feedback on real diagnoses vs. AI suggestions, the system could learn from this data.  
  We envision integrating a feedback loop so Medi‚Äôs AI becomes smarter over time, adapting to the specific population of the hospital and improving accuracy of its predictions.

## üß™ Feature List

Beyond the core features above, Medi offers a range of supporting features to create a comprehensive healthcare platform:

- **Real-time Sync & Notifications**:  
  Appointments, queue status, and messages update in real time across all devices.  
  For example, when an admin schedules a new appointment, the patient sees it immediately on their portal (and gets an email/SMS or in-app notification).  
  Reminders for upcoming appointments or medication refills are sent automatically, reducing no-shows and missed doses.

- **Secure In-Platform Messaging**:  
  Patients and doctors can communicate via a built-in messaging system without resorting to insecure channels.  
  All messages are encrypted and stored in the platform, tied to patient records for context.  
  This allows follow-up questions, prescription clarifications, or sharing of test results in a secure, private manner.

- **Multi-Role Access Control**:  
  The platform supports **four distinct user roles** ‚Äì Admin, Doctor, Patient, and Nurse ‚Äì each with appropriate permissions and UIs.  
  A single database underpins all users, with role-based authentication rules (leveraging Supabase Auth) to ensure data privacy.  
  (For instance, doctors can view their patients‚Äô records but not others; patients only see their own data; nurses can check in patients but not access sensitive records; admins have global access.)

- **Online AI Triage**:  
  The patient portal‚Äôs **Online Triage** feature provides an at-home preliminary diagnosis service.  
  It‚Äôs like having a virtual doctor available 24/7 for basic advice. This can help patients decide if they need to come in immediately, which doctor they should see, or if they might handle a mild illness at home with rest and over-the-counter meds ‚Äì all based on AI analysis of their input.

- **Appointment Management & Reminders**:  
  Patients can self-schedule appointments based on doctor availability, and reschedule or cancel if needed.  
  The system sends confirmation and reminder notifications (which can be delivered via email or push notification).  

  On the doctor‚Äôs side, their calendar is automatically updated, and they can set how many appointment slots to offer each day.  
  The **smart scheduling** ensures that appointment times don‚Äôt clash, and it can even enforce rules like buffer times between appointments or limits per day.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

Interested in running Medi locally or trying it out? Below are instructions to get each component up and running:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (>=14) and **npm** ‚Äì required for both the web frontend and the mobile app.
- **Expo CLI** (for mobile) ‚Äì install with `npm install -g expo-cli` or use `npx expo` as needed.
- **Python 3.9+** (optional, for AI API) ‚Äì if you want to run the FastAPI server for the AI models locally.
- **Arduino IDE** (optional, for IoT) ‚Äì if you plan to upload code to the ESP8266 RFID scanner hardware.

---

### Running the Web App (Frontend)

**1. Clone this repository to your local machine.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/medi-platform.git
cd medi-platform
```

**2. Install dependencies:**
Navigate to the frontend code (e.g., cd frontend) if the code is in a subfolder, otherwise stay in root if it‚Äôs directly there. Then run:
```bash
npm install
```
This will fetch all React, Tailwind, and other dependencies.

**3. Set up environment variables:**  
Medi uses Supabase for its backend. Copy the provided `.env.example` (or create a new `.env` file) in the frontend directory.  
You‚Äôll need to provide your Supabase project URL and the public anon key so the frontend can communicate with the database and auth. For example:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://YourProjectID.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=public-anon-key-goes-here
```

(The exact variable names might differ based on the project configuration; check the code or documentation in this repo.)

**4. Start the development server: **
Once env vars are set, run:
```
npm run dev || npm run dev1
```

This will launch the web app on a local dev server (usually at http://localhost:5000 or http://localhost:5001 for Vite).
You can then open this URL in your browser to see the Medi web portal.

**5. Login / seeding data:**
By default, you might need to register a new user. Use the Sign Up page to create an account (you can choose role: Patient, Doctor, etc. on sign-up if implemented).
If the app expects some preset data (like an admin account or preset doctors), you may need to insert those into the Supabase database manually or via a provided SQL seed.
(Check the repository docs for any SQL dump or use Supabase dashboard to add entries.)

### Running the Mobile App (QR-nurse)

The mobile app resides in a separate repository. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the QR-nurse repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ilhanmuftic/QR-nurse.git
cd QR-nurse
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure environment:**  
   Similar to the web app, the mobile app needs to know the backend endpoints.  
   This might include the Supabase URL and anon key (if it uses Supabase directly) or the URL of the FastAPI AI server.  
   Check the `constants/` or config files in the QR-nurse code for any API URLs.  

   Update those if needed to point to your instance (for demo purposes, it might already be configured to a cloud instance of the hackathon project ‚Äì but those might not be publicly accessible, so using your own Supabase instance is recommended).

4. **Run the app:**  
   Start the Expo development server:
```bash
npm start
```

This will open Expo Dev Tools in your browser. You can then do one of the following:

- Use the **Expo Go** app on your phone to scan the QR code in the terminal or Expo Dev Tools ‚Äì this will load the app on your physical device.
- Or press `i` to launch the iOS simulator (Mac only), or `a` for Android emulator, if set up.

5. **Test the features:**  
   Log in on the mobile app using a nurse or admin account (you might need to create one via the web app or Supabase).  
   Test scanning by using an actual NFC tag/QR code or by manually entering an ID if a debug mode exists.  
   Ensure your mobile device is on the same network as your backend if you run Supabase locally (or use tunnel solutions like ngrok for the FastAPI server if needed).

---

## üîß Setting up the Backend (Supabase & FastAPI)

Since Medi uses Supabase for most backend functionality, setting that up is crucial:

1. **Supabase Setup:**  
   Create a free account on Supabase and start a new project.  
   Note the **API URL** and **anon API key** (find these in your project settings ‚Äì they‚Äôll be used by the frontends as noted).

2. **Database Schema:**  
   Use the Supabase SQL editor or the provided scripts (if any in `/backend` or `/database` folder of this repo) to create the necessary tables and roles.  
   Typical tables might include `users` (if not using Supabase Auth default), `profiles` (for user details if using Auth), `doctors`, `patients`, `appointments`, `medical_records`, `messages`, etc.  

   Set up **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies if required, to enforce that users can only access their own data (Supabase Auth can help with this).  
   If an SQL dump is provided in the repo, executing that will be the quickest way to mirror the intended schema.

3. **Edge Functions:**  
   If the repository includes a directory like `/edge-functions` with function code (likely in TypeScript/JavaScript), you can deploy these to your Supabase instance.  
   Install Supabase CLI and run `supabase login`, then inside the project directory run:

   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy name-of-function
   ```

For each function. Functions might handle things like processing check-in events or integrating with external APIs.
Ensure to set any required environment variables for these functions (e.g., secrets for third-party APIs or OpenAI keys if relevant).

4. **FastAPI AI Service:**  
   To enable the AI features (triage and prescription suggestions), you should run the FastAPI server.  
   The code for this might be in the `/backend` folder of this repo (e.g., a `main.py` or similar).  
   If it‚Äôs not included (perhaps due to large model files), you may use a placeholder or mock.  
   However, assuming it is included or you have access:

   - Create a Python virtual environment and activate it:

     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```

   - Install requirements (this would include FastAPI, Uvicorn, and possibly transformers for the models):

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   - Run the server (adjust module/name as needed):

     ```bash
     uvicorn main:app --reload
     ```

     This will start the API on `http://localhost:8000` by default.

   - Make sure the frontend knows the URL of this API.  
     In a hackathon scenario, this might have been a local URL or an IP address.  
     You might need to update a config file or environment variable so that when a patient uses the triage form, the request is sent to this FastAPI endpoint.

5. **Connecting IoT (Optional):**  
   If you have the hardware, clone the Arduino code from the `ssst-hackathon-arduino` repository.  
   Open the project in Arduino IDE.  

   - Update the WiFi credentials in the code (`SSID` and `PASSWORD`)
   - Set the endpoint or keys for connecting to your backend  
     (the code might use an HTTP endpoint or directly talk to Supabase via a REST interface ‚Äî adjust it to point to your Supabase project‚Äôs URL or the function URL)

   Then flash the code to your ESP8266.  
   Once configured, scanning an RFID tag will trigger an event to your running backend ‚Äî you should see logs or changes in your Supabase DB when a card is scanned.

> **Note:**  
> All components (web, mobile, API, IoT) are decoupled and communicate through network calls.  
> You can run the web app without the IoT or AI components (you‚Äôll just get placeholders or need manual input for triage).  
> Similarly, you can demo the AI features by calling the FastAPI endpoints directly.  
> Integrating everything is the goal for a full demo, but each piece can work on its own for development purposes.  
> Always ensure the configuration (URLs, keys) are set correctly so the pieces know how to talk to each other.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The Medi project is organized for clarity and modularity. Here‚Äôs an overview of the repository structure:

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                     # Additional config files (eslint, prettier, CI/CD, etc.)

*Some notes on the structure:* The **frontend** contains the React app for the web interface.  
The **backend** folder (if present) holds the AI service code (e.g., FastAPI).  
Supabase-related code (like SQL or edge functions) is organized under **supabase/**.  
The mobile app is not part of this repo; it lives in its own project (to keep this repo focused and lightweight).  
By separating concerns this way, each part of Medi can be worked on independently by different team members or even open-sourced separately  
(for example, others could reuse the AI triage module or the mobile app for similar projects).

## üìå Roadmap

While the current version of Medi is a hackathon prototype, we have a vision for expanding its capabilities into a full-fledged product.  
Here are some planned features and enhancements for the future:

- **Insurance & Billing Integration**:  
  Add modules for handling insurance information, claims, and billing workflows.  
  For instance, patients could upload their insurance details, and the hospital staff can process claims through the platform.  
  Generating invoices, processing payments, and tracking outstanding bills would make Medi an end-to-end solution for hospital administration.

- **Smart Scheduling**:  
  Implement AI-driven scheduling optimization.  
  This could include automatically suggesting appointment slots to patients based on their location and doctor availability,  
  or dynamically reallocating time slots when cancellations occur.  
  The goal is to minimize wait times and maximize doctors‚Äô utilization.  
  For example, if a doctor has a gap in the schedule, Medi could suggest moving up a waiting patient into that slot and notify them.

- **Telehealth & Remote Monitoring**:  
  Extend Medi to support telemedicine appointments (with video conferencing integration) so doctors can consult patients remotely.  
  Also, integrate wearable/IoT health devices (like smartwatches, glucometers, etc.) to feed live vitals into the patient‚Äôs profile.  
  This would enable real-time health tracking and even alert doctors if a patient‚Äôs readings go out of a safe range.

- **Government & External API Integration**:  
  Connect with national health systems or external databases for things like automatic retrieval of patient medical history (with consent),  
  e-prescription services, or reporting notifiable diseases to public health authorities.  
  For example, Medi could use a government API to verify a patient‚Äôs insurance or to pull vaccination records into their profile.  
  This would make onboarding new patients faster and ensure data consistency with broader health networks.

- **Enhanced AI Models**:  
  Continuously improve the AI triage accuracy by fine-tuning on real hospital data (while respecting privacy).  
  We also plan to explore using larger models or knowledge graphs for drug interactions and contraindications ‚Äî  
  so that the AI prescription assistant becomes even more reliable.  
  Another idea is an AI-powered **chatbot** within the patient portal for answering common health questions  
  or guiding them through a symptom check interactively.

- **Scalability & Multi-Hospital Support**:  
  Evolve the platform to support multiple hospitals/clinics in one system (multi-tenancy),  
  so that each hospital can have its own admin and data isolated from others.  
  Also, focus on scalability and performance ‚Äî ensuring the system can handle thousands of concurrent users,  
  secure data partitioning, and failover for critical services.

- **UI/UX Refinements**:  
  Based on user feedback (from doctors, nurses, patients), refine the interface to be even more user-friendly.  
  This includes more mobile-responsive pages for patient/doctor on the web app,  
  dark mode for those long hospital nights üåô, and localization support (multi-language) for international deployments.

## üß° Note

This project was originally built in a hackathon setting, which means it was developed in a short time frame to showcase a concept.  
Despite that, we followed best practices and used production-grade tools to ensure **real potential for scaling into a full production environment**.  

The foundation laid by Medi ‚Äì a unified web/mobile/IoT platform with AI integration ‚Äì is strong, but it‚Äôs just the beginning.  
With further development, testing, and feedback from healthcare professionals, Medi could evolve from a demo into a deployed system making a real impact in hospitals and clinics.  

We‚Äôre excited about the possibilities and welcome collaboration or input from others who share the vision of smarter, AI-driven healthcare management.
